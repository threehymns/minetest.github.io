    Since 2019, more than 600 primary school students from 30 classes in 3
    different countries have replicated heritage sites (like Notre-Dame de
    Paris, the medieval Louvre castle or the Besançon citadel), placed them on
    an interactive timeline and gave tours and presentations in the virtual
    world.

    Between November 2021 and June 2022, secondary school students from
    Aulney-sous-Bois in France have reinvented their neighborhood with Luanti.
    This project, coordinated by the IRI foundation and the teachers, allowed
    the students to explore the digital practice of cooperative and contributive
    construction. The projects created emphasized well-being and the
    neighborhood's conviviality.

    The UNEJ project (*Urbanités Numériques En Jeux*) is a 4 years project where
    teachers and students discover about urban planning while building concrete
    proposals for their neighborhood's development with the help of
    professionals from the sector. It is done in connection with the urban
    transformations carried out for the 2024 Olympics.

    A Workshop for the city of Maubeuge in France where groups of young citizens
    between 10 and 16 years old shared ideas to improve their neighborhood. They
    then built them in an in-game map of their city, allowing urban planners to
    see what young people wanted for their local area and discuss current issues
    with them.

    A 9 week project with two classes of Grade 3 students. Aside from learning
    how to play the game together and various ICT skills (screenshots, image
    manipulation and importing), I wanted my students to research, plan and
    design their building project and reflect on the process.
